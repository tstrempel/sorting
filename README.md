# Sorting Algorithms

## Compiling

`make`

## Usage

`./sorting <algorithm> <array_size>`

- sorts 100 arrays of size `<array_size>` with algorithm `<algorithm>`

- algorithm:
  - selectionsort (self-implemented)
  - insertionsort (self-implemented)
  - quicksort (self-implemented)
  - quicksort (standard c library function)

- array\_size:
  - size (integer) of the array to sort

## Optimization

- sorting-O2 and sorting-O3 were compiled with the -O2 or -O3 flags respectively.
- The usage remains the same
